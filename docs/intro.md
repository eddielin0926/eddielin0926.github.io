# About Me

Hi! I'm Eddie Lin, a graduate student in Information Networking at Carnegie Mellon University.
I’m passionate about building robust systems, from distributed databases and custom job schedulers to full-stack web apps.

I enjoy learning by doing — most of my free time goes into side projects where I explore new ideas, experiment with architectures, and build things that (sometimes) work.
